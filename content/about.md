Hi, I’m Mackenzie Wood! I’m a Data Science student, professional soccer player, and passionate advocate for women in business and tech. Currently, I’m finishing my Master’s degree in Data Science at Northwestern University, after completing my Master’s in Business Analytics with a focus on Sports Analytics at the University of Notre Dame, where I graduated magna cum laude. I also hold a double major in Statistics and Communication Studies from Northwestern.

Alongside my academic work, I play professional soccer for the Chicago Red Stars in the NWSL. The discipline, teamwork, and strategic thinking required on the field fuel my approach to data science, especially when analyzing sports performance and team dynamics.

I’m also a Data Science Researcher for Forte Women in Business, where I apply data-driven strategies to help empower women in leadership roles.

What I Do:

Data Science Research & Sports Analytics
Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling
Women’s Leadership & Diversity Advocacy
Sports Performance Analysis
Whether I’m studying data, playing soccer, or researching ways to support women in business, I’m driven by a passion for learning and creating impact through data. Let’s connect!
